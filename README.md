This project is a single-page application (SPA) named Beats, designed for selling keyboards. It leverages React Router to implement the SPA architecture, providing seamless navigation. React Query from TanStack is utilized to simplify data fetching and state management. Context API is employed to manage states for the entire application, including authorization and cart functionalities. As a full-stack application, it connects to a Supabase backend to manage data. Additionally, the project uses shadcn/ui for rapid scalability and an aesthetically pleasing design.
